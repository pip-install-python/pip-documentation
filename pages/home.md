# Pip Install Python Documentation:


> **A modern, responsive documentation system for the custom Dash components, software and research that I design and maintain.**

Welcome to my notebook, I'm glad you're here! This documentation site was built to leverage llms and ai with specific endpoints for each page and an integrated Claude Haiku chatbot to help you navigate and understand the contents of the site.
---

These are some of the available urls for ai's to best read and work with the contents of this site:

[/llms.txt](/llms.txt), [/architecture.txt](/architecture.txt), [/robots.txt](/robots.txt) and [/sitemap.xml](/sitemap.xml)
